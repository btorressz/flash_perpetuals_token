## **Smart Contract(program) Architecture**
The **Flash Perpetuals Token** program consists of multiple **on-chain components** working together to facilitate **fast, secure perpetual trading**.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Global State (Protocol Configuration)**
The **GlobalState** account serves as the **central registry** for protocol-wide parameters:
- **Admin Authority:** The admin manages protocol settings, including **fee rates and liquidation parameters**.
- **Fee and Funding Rates:** Dynamically adjusts **funding payments between long and short positions**.
- **Merkle Orderbook Root:** A **Merkle tree-based order execution system** ensuring **tamper-proof, high-speed trading**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Trader State (User Accounts)**
Each trader has a **TraderState account**, which stores:
- **Staked FPT Tokens:** Required to access **leveraged trading**.
- **Open Positions:** Tracks the trader‚Äôs **leverage and margin levels**.
- **Liquidation Risk:** If a trader‚Äôs **margin falls below maintenance**, they are **partially or fully liquidated**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Liquidity Provider (LP) State**
LPs provide capital to support perpetual trading. The **LpState** account tracks:
- **Total LP Stake:** Liquidity providers must stake FPT to **earn trading fees**.
- **Trading Volume-Based Rewards:** LPs receive rewards **based on their contribution to liquidity depth**.
- **Hedging System Integration:** LP funds are automatically **hedged to minimize risk exposure**.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ High-Frequency Trading Execution System**
To support **low-latency order execution**, the protocol includes:
- **Batch Trade Execution:** Traders can **submit multiple orders in a single transaction**.
- **Merkle-Based Order Validation:** Ensures **tamper-proof order verification**.
